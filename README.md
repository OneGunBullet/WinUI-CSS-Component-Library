# WinUI-like CSS Component Library

This repository contains a single-file CSS library (winui.css) and a demo HTML showing many WinUI/Fluent-inspired components that you can use when theming YouTube or other web apps.

Files:
- winui.css — tokenized CSS with components and animations.
- demo.html — example markup + small JS to demonstrate interactive behaviors.

Quick start:
1. Add `winui.css` to your project and include it in your page:
   `<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/winui.css">`

2. Toggle dark mode by setting a data attribute:
   `<html data-theme="dark">...</html>`

3. Customize tokens by overriding CSS variables:
   ```
   :root{
     --accent-100: #ff2d55;
     --winui-radius: 12px;
   }
   ```

Accessibility and notes:
- This library approximates visual aspects of WinUI (mica, acrylic, reveal). It is not a full semantic or accessible component library — for production, add aria-attributes, keyboard handling, roving tabindex, and focus management.
- Acrylic uses `backdrop-filter` which is not available in all browsers. Provide fallbacks as needed.

If you want:
- SCSS modular version
- A JavaScript helper for accessible menus and dialog focus-trap
- Integration hints for your YouTube userstyle (stylus / userscript)
Please ask and I will produce it.
